# aplc_optimization: Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph (APLC) design optimization toolkit

`aplc_optimization` is an object-orientated software toolkit to simplify the organization,
execution and evaluation of large APLC design surveys.

Documentation can be found in the [docs/](https://github.com/spacetelescope/aplc_optimization/tree/master/docs) folder of this source distribution.

## Requirements & Installation

#### Prerequesits
- Gurobi solver for Python. For licensing and installation instructions see [gurobipy](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/quickstart_mac/cs_grbpy_the_gurobi_python.html), as well as the `aplc_optimization` [documentation](https://github.com/spacetelescope/aplc_optimization/tree/master/docs/installing.md).

#### Installing
`aplc_optmization` has the following strong depenecies:
 - numpy, scipy, matplotlib etc
 - astropy
 - hcipy

- The `aplc_optimization` package was created in support of the [Segmented Coronagraph Design and Analysis (SCDA) study](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/technology/SCDA/), funded by NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP). The goal of this study is to develop viable coronagraph instrument concepts for a LUVOIR-type mission. The apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph (APLC) is one of several coronagraph design families that the SCDA study is assessing.
